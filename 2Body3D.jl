    Inputs:
        state vector u - 6 states, [x₁, y₁, z₁, x₂, y₂, z₂, ẋ₁, ẏ₁, ż₁, ẋ₂, ẏ₂, ż₂], as motion of central body is not concerned
        p - parameters to pass to function, has structure : [satelliteMass, centralBody, perturbations]
            satelliteMass - contains a value representing the mass of the satellite

            centralBody - will have structure [mass, radius, J2] of the central body

            perturbations - will have structure [nothing], override by adding in the string name of each perturbation type, i.e. "J2" in order to apply the accelerations from J2 to the system
    Output:
        du - the derivative of the state vector i.e. u̇
